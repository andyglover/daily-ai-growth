# daily-ai-growth

An at-a-glance progress tracker and action plan to help you learn and utilize AI tools effectively.

# Overview

This project is a single-page HTML/CSS document that serves as a daily/weekly AI development roadmap. I created this to help me track my learning, and engagement with AI. By dedicating consistent time to activities like content creation, networking, and practical implementation, I hope to steadily increase my AI fluency.

# How It Was Created

- Prompt Ideation – Ideas for the overall structure, layout, and content were collected from prompting multiple AI models via Perplexity. This allowed for a broad creative brainstorming process on what sections to include, how best to organize them, and style the page.
- ChatGPT Generation – After refining the outline, ChatGPT's o1 was used to generate the code.
- A fully AI Approach - I wanted to see what I could achieve in a short amount of time by only using AI tools to accomplish this.
- Post-prompting adjustments - I adjusted the template to closer fit my needs after the LLM generated it.

# Why AI Tracking?

AI is rapidly evolving and has widespread applications in both personal and professional domains. Keeping track of daily and weekly activities, and monthly goals and milestones helps ensure you don’t just read about AI but actively apply it, create valuable connections, and continue to build new skills over time.
